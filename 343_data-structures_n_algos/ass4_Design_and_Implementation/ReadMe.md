Design Requirements
---

Your design should document the work that needs to be done to complete the assignment. It should be a complete and clear description of how the program is organized. The more time you spend on your design, the less you will spend coding, debugging, and modifying. Your design should include (at least) the following components in this order:

- Overview: This is a short description of the design and how the pieces fit together (the interaction between the classes). Include a description of main (List the objects that you have. Main should be short.)
- Class diagram: This is a UML diagram showing class relationships, including inheritance and composition. You can use Visio or neatly draw this by hand.
- Class descriptions: For each class in the design, describe the data and methods as part of a documented C++ header file (Exception: you do not need to include h files of classes you will not implement, of the extensions beyond the assignment specifications, but you must include a description of those classes). The task that each function performs and the purpose of each data member should be clearly described. High-level pseudo code should be included for the most important methods (for example, those that control the flow of the program). Not all parameters need to be included for methods. Please order the files properly, i.e., put the most important classes first, put parent classes before children classes.

You should put considerable effort into the design (comparable to a lab implementation) or you should not expect to receive a good score. A useful approach is to imagine that you are writing a design that someone else will need to implement and extend. Document your design as you would want someone else to document for you. Some questions you might want to ask yourself:

- Can your design be extended beyond the specifications given here?
- Could you easily add new videos or DVDs to your design?
- Can you easily add other categories of videos or DVDs?
- Could you easily add new categories of media to your design, for example, music?
- Could you expand to check out other kinds of items, for example VCRs or DVD players?
- Could you easily add new operations to your design?
- Could you incorporate time, for example, a due date for borrowed items?
- Could you easily add an additional store, or handle a chain of stores?

Your design can go beyond the scope of these specifications (and you wonâ€™t need to implement extensions). Thinking of possible extensions in advance often improves the design.

Bring a hardcopy of your design to class on Feb. 26. We will have in-class design reviews and then your hardcopy will be turned in. No softcopy will be necessary.
