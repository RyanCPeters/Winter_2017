1. Name of person who you are providing feedback for: Sarah Robbins

2. Ratings Participation, Communication, Competence, and Quality of Work
- Participation   (0 to 4 [highest])     4
- Communication   (0 to 4 [highest])     4
- Competence      (0 to 4 [highest])     4
- Quality of Work (0 to 4 [highest])     4 

 - Blanket disclaimer for each member of the group: 
   + I realize that it seems unhelpful to give all 4's across the board, but I honestly can't think of anything that Marc could have done better in his roles for the group.

3. What is their superpower?  What is the skill that they are great at and contributes to the team the most?
- Attention to detail, prioritizing objectives, quality control, and process improvement... ie., Sarah is the Project Manager supreme, or a guardian angle... Either way, this group was only able to come together and get work done because of Sarah's natural talents for managing technically complex project requirements and personnel.

4. What should they do more of?
- Whooping Ryan's ass for not checking in on team progress as often as he should.

5. What should they do less of (if anything)?
- It seems that stressing over the little details is Sarah's thing, and it's a large part of why she is the idealized example of a future project manager. Butt, she may want to keep her pet peeves on the down low, as it's too easy for certain trololo's to use them to ruffle her feathers.

6. What should they make sure they keep doing?
- Sarah has a natural inclination for taking charge, establishing clear expectations/communication, and mutually respectful delegation of responsibility. Please, please, please, never stop doing these things! 

7. Any other feedback for them?
-  You seriously need to buy a new hat... I suggest something with either a Halo on top of it, or a help just a big helmet with wings on the sides. ;)
