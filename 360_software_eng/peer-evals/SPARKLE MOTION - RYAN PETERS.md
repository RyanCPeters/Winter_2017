- Ryan would often disappear from team chat for days at a time. Though he would generally handle his assigned duties, he left the team in suspense far too often. 

3. What is their superpower?  What is the skill that they are great at and contributes to the team the most?
- Two words: Tunnel Vision... Ryan doesn't track multiple objectives worth a damn, but given a single clear responsibility, he will develop that responsibility into a stand-alone project, for better or worse, even if he only really needed to write a single paragraph on the topic.

4. What should they do more of?
- Check in with the group more often, and seek feed-back on if his work is still in line with project objectives.

5. What should they do less of (if anything)?
- Disappearing for days at a time...
  + When the group was working on the Project Requirements document, Ryan had some trouble with a medication he was taking and wasn't able to be an active contributor to the groups work on that document. This wasn't an issue for the group, other than he didn't bother to tell the team his situation and as a result they had to scramble to cover his portion of the workload at the last minute.

6. What should they make sure they keep doing?
- Technical and analytic thoroughness is always welcome, just don't overdo it where it isn't essential.

7. Any other feedback for them?
