2. Ratings Participation, Communication, Competence, and Quality of Work
- Participation   (0 to 4 [highest])     4

- Quality of Work (0 to 4 [highest])     4 
 
 - Blanket disclaimer for each member of the group: 
   + I realize that it seems unhelpful to give all 4's across the board, but I honestly can't think of anything that Marc could have done better in his roles for the group.

3. What is their superpower?  What is the skill that they are great at and contributes to the team the most?
- Super Power: Marc was seemingly able to just snap his fingers and it would magically produce exactly what the group needed from him. 
- Example: When we were doing the initial preparations for the mid-quarter check-in presentation, Marc produced the contextual diagram we needed with very little guidance or input from the rest of us. That diagram went on to be a critical point of reference for us in the ongoing stages of planning and development of our product. 

4. What should they do more of?
- Marc demonstrated a fantastic ability to keep his bearings amidst the messy and chaotic early stages of concept design. This clarity amidst the haze is a key trait for a project lead; as such, **Marc should step forward in his future team projects as a leader and guide for others that are easily lost in semantics**.


5. What should they do less of (if anything)?
- Marc is a very smart person, but he seems too unsure of himself in spite of that fact. He needs to be less content with letting others call the shots so that his ideas can be heard sooner in the development cycle.

6. What should they make sure they keep doing?
- The highly respectful tone and demeanor he uses when communicating with his team makes him very approachable when objectives become unclear. This is another key characteristic of a good leader, and if Marc is to ever become a project lead when he enters industry, he will need to be sure that he remains approachable to his team. 

7. Any other feedback for them?
- Stop making success look so easy ;)
