1.  Name of person who you are providing feedback for: Torren Sampson

2. Ratings Participation, Communication, Competence, and Quality of Work
- Participation   (0 to 4 [highest])     4
- Communication   (0 to 4 [highest])     4
- Competence      (0 to 4 [highest])     4
- Quality of Work (0 to 4 [highest])     4 

 - Blanket disclaimer for each member of the group: 
   + I realize that it seems unhelpful to give all 4's across the board, but I honestly can't think of anything that Marc could have done better in his roles for the group.

3. What is their superpower?  What is the skill that they are great at and contributes to the team the most?
- Torrent (^.-) can only be described as an impossible mix of seemingly contradictory things:
  + Socially well adjusted, normal dood
  + Uber-techy-nerd that makes solving technically complex problems look simple.
- Torren was the key player in our group. His ability to fully process the technical elements of the project while acting as the social glue that permitted Sarah's demand for perfection to gel with Ryan's often flippant attitude on top of Marc's Lebowski-like Dudliness. 

4. What should they do more of?
- Assert, Torrent (-.^) needs to assert more. He has good ideas, he just seems to be overly worried that he's stepping on people's toes with them.

5. What should they do less of (if anything)?
- Torren should probably stop worrying about what other people can, or can't, handle. If he just lays his ideas out for others to work with, he'll naturally rise to a position of leadership befitting a person of his competence.

6. What should they make sure they keep doing?
- Chewing bubble-gum, because if all Torren did was kick ass, he'd need to buy yet another new pair of boots ;)

7. Any other feedback for them?
- Don't hesitate to question other people when their ideas or expectations differ from your own. It often seemed that you were holding back your ideas for what the group needed to consider in the project for fear that you would contradict other people's ambitions.
