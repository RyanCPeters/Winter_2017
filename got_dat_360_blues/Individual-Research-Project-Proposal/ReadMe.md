Is the open source approach to systems of systems design viable?

#### Elevator Pitch
I've heard a lot of people talking about open source code bases as being the way of the future. But I can't say that I see how that's going to work; I understand the altruistic goals of such endeavors, but I also understand that without an organized, funded, and adaptive govorning board of stakeholders in a project, there's no amount of certainty that open source projects will be able to survive the eb and sway of popular culture.

#### Rationale:
- why you are interested in the topic in the context of software engineering practice
- which SW Engineering topics your research will address
- what is the significance for you of investigating it
- what is your goal in the project

Currently, there are a stagaring number of "citizen scientists" in the world that are capable of stepping up to the plate and making significant individual contributions towards solving major obsticals to both industry and society. But when everybody is independently racing to the next big solution, we run the risk of missing the mark and instead of creating a common solution we can all support, we get a situation similar to what's seen in the xkcd comic's "Standards" skit.

![xkcd: Standard](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/standards.png "Fortunately, the charging one has been solved now that we've all standardized on mini-USB, or is it micro-USB? Shit.")

In researching this subject, I hope to be able to determine, for myself at least, if I will choose to a part of the open source movement, or if I will try to mitigate its percieved damages.


#### Research Approach (1 short paragraph)

- how are you going to approach investigating it (journal articles, books, interviews, surveys, a study, metrics, etc.)

I already have multiple scholarly articles from multiple academic databases, So I think I will review those and use them as my primary source of research.

#### Conclusion: (1 paragraph or set of bullet points)

- when you are done with the individual research, what new knowledge will you gain (be specific)

An understanding of the possible risks and advantages that come from open sourced, publicly developed tools and platforms. 

#### Potential references/sources you are considering:  (min. 2, be specific even if you change your mind later)
