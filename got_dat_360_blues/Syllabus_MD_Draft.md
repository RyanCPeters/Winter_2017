Course Description
===

Surveys the software engineering processes, tools, and techniques used in software development and quality assurance. Topics include life-cycle models, process modeling, requirements analysis and specification techniques, quality assurance techniques, verification and validation, testing, project planning, and management.

#### Learning Outcomes:

- Be able to define and describe: a) software industry and its practices, processes and projects; b) lifecycle development methods; c) software developer roles, responsibilities and ethics.
- Be able to compare and contrast plan-driven and agile development processes.
- Be able to use knowledge about the software development process and software engineering practices to select and justify approaches to use given a project, its teams, and its constraints.
- Be able to examine trade-offs between software engineering techniques and methods.
- Be able to work with a team on creating software artifacts or work products.

#### Course Prerequisites:

CSS 301, which may be taken concurrently; either CSS 341 or CSS 342 which may be taken concurrently; may not be repeated.

#### Readings:

**Required**: _Software Engineering_, 10th ed., Ian Sommerville, Pearson, 2016

**Additional Readings**: Required electronic reserve readings will be assigned. These will be posted on the course website.

**Lectures**: A subset of the lecture slides will be posted.

#### Evaluation and Grading:

The student’s final grade will be based on the following

- Quizzes: 5%
- Midterm and Final: 45%
- Group Project: 20%
- Individual Research: 15%
- Class Activities: 10%
- Class Participation: 5%

Extra credit points, if announced in class, will count toward the class activities or participation.

If you miss taking the midterm and/or the final, you will not pass the class.

The overall course grade will be based on a 100-pt scale. The official decimal class grades (0.0 - 4.0) will be determined from a weighted average of your individual grades. This scale represents a minimum decimal grade.

The following table represents the official UW conversion of standard letter grades to the UW decimal grade scale and the conversion to the 100-pt scale used in this class:


| . | A Range|| B Range||| C Range||| D Range|||
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Letter | A | A- | B+ | B | B- | C+ | C | C- | D+ | D | D | 
| Min Decimal | 3.9 | 3.5 | 3.2 | 2.9 | 2.5 | 2.2 | 1.9 | 1.5 | 1.2 | 0.9 | 0.7 |
| Min 100-pt | 95 | 90 | 85 | 82 | 78 | 75 | 72 | 68 | 65 | 62 | 60 |


Expectations:
Readings
Please be sure to do the assigned reading before you come to class. Some of these assigned
readings are required for the class activities. The exams will also include the assigned readings.

Group Work
A multi-part group project will give you an opportunity to apply the concepts covered in class.
Each group member will be given an opportunity to provide feedback to me regarding the
relative contributions of each of the group members. I will use this collective feedback when
assigning term project grades to individual group members.
“Equal Contribution” will be assumed by default. If this is not the case for your group, you may
let me know / fill out an evaluation form after each assignment is submitted.
Keeping in Touch
Check the course website often. Assignment descriptions and lecture notes will be posted on
the site. When you send a canvas message, make sure to include “CSS360A” in the Subject field.
Otherwise, I may not respond to your email.
Please submit your questions to the class Discussion board, because other students may have
the same question and because others in the class may be able to answer your question before
I can.
Late Policy
Deliverables must be completed on the specified due date unless you make prior arrangements
with me. The late penalty for all deliverables is 10% per day. If you hand in your deliverable at
any time between the due date and the next 24 hours, you will receive a maximum grade of 90
(out of 100). Since most of your deliverables will be in terms of your term project with your
team, there should be no reason for submitting a late assignment.
Missed Exams
No make-ups, except in exceptional situations (and be prepared to offer any supporting
documentation I ask for). If you know ahead of time that you have scheduling conflicts, e.g.
work-related, see me ahead of time so that you can take the exam prior to the scheduled date.
No make-ups for the quiz.
Electronic Devices
No electronic devices during quizzes and exams. Laptops may be used for taking notes or inclass
exercises.
Student Conduct; Plagiarism and Cheating
You are expected to provide original work based on your own effort for this course. You will
receive a zero for any coursework for which you are discovered cheating or plagiarizing. You will
be referred to the University for further action. It is your responsibility to know and uphold the
Student Conduct Code for the University of Washington, available at
http://www.uwb.edu/students/policies/

Special Needs
Access and Accommodations. Your experience in this class is important to me. If you have
already established accommodations with Disability Resources for Students (DRS), please
communicate your approved accommodations to me at your earliest convenience so we can
discuss your needs in this course.
If you have not yet established services through DRS, but have a temporary health condition or
permanent disability that requires accommodations (conditions include but not limited to;
mental health, attention-related, learning, vision, hearing, physical or health impacts), you are
welcome to contact DRS at 425-352-5307 or uwbdrs@uw.edu. DRS offers resources and
coordinates reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities and/or temporary health
conditions. Reasonable accommodations are established through an interactive process
between you, your instructor(s), and DRS. It is the policy and practice of the University of
Washington to create inclusive and accessible learning environments consistent with federal
and state law.
For Our Veterans. If you are a student who has served in our nation’s military forces, welcome
home, and thank you for your service. I hope that you feel comfortable enough to confidentially
self-identify yourself to me so I can help you make a successful transition from the military to
higher education.
